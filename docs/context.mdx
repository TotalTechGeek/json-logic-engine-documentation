<h1>Context Operators</h1>

Operators | Instruction
-- | --
val | val
exists | exists
var | var
missing | missing
missing_some | missing_some

These operators allow you to fetch data from the context &amp; check for the existence of values.


## val 

The `val` operator is used to fetch data from the context, and is the preferred method of fetching data in JSON Logic Core.

This operator receives the path to the data you wish to fetch, and returns the value.


<LogicRunner defaultLogic={{
    val: 'name'
}} defaultData={{ name: 'John' }} />


If you wish, you can descend into objects and arrays:

<LogicRunner defaultLogic={{
    val: ['a', 'b', 'c']
}} defaultData={{ a: { b: { c: 5 } } }} />

## exists

This operator is used to check if a value exists in the context.

<LogicRunner defaultLogic={{
    exists: 'name'
}} defaultData={{ name: 'John' }} />


## var


> ⚠️ This operator has been deprecated. It will continue to work, but is considered a legacy operator. Consider: `val`

By just using `''` as the input for var, you can get the current value that is in scope, regardless of its type.

Additionally, these operators support handlebars style data traversal inside of higher order operators. 


<LogicRunner defaultLogic={{
    var: ''
}} defaultData={"Test"} />

If you wish, you can drill down and fetch specific properties: 


<LogicRunner defaultLogic={{
    '+': [{var: 'a'}, { var: 'b.c'}, { var: 'd.0' }]
}} defaultData={{
    a: 1,
    b: { c: 2 },
    d: [3]
}} />




## Missing


> ⚠️ This operator has been deprecated. It will continue to work, but is considered a legacy operator.
> Consider: `exists`

Returns an array of the values that are "missing"

<LogicRunner defaultLogic={{
    'missing': ['a', 'b']
}} defaultData={{ a: true}} />


## Missing Some


> ⚠️ This operator has been deprecated. It will continue to work, but is considered a legacy operator.
> Consider: `exists`

From `json-logic-js`, passing in the number of required variables &amp; the variable names, if it has enough of them, it'll return an empty array, otherwise it'll return the items that are missing.

<LogicRunner defaultLogic={{
    'missing_some': [1, ['a', 'b', 'c']]
}} defaultData={{ a: true}} />
